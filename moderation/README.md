{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">As a staff member, it is important to be consistent in giving punishments and to ensure that players understand why they are being punished. This prevents players from receiving different punishments for the same offense, keeping it fair for everyone.</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">An overview of the punishments follows for each offense. We write down</mark> #1, #2, or #3 <mark style="color:orange;">after a warn to count a repeat of an offense within a category. This helps other staff members in the future to give an appropriate punishment if an offense is repeated by someone.</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">Punishments are only visible to staff members by default. By using</mark> '-p' <mark style="color:red;">after a punishment, it can be made public so everyone can see it in the chat. Use this in situations where you also want to warn others about the consequences of breaking the rules.</mark>
{% endhint %}

`Note: Once a punishment has been made i.e. ban/mute/warn it must be recorded in the #notes Discord channel. You can additionally make notes in game with the command **/notes add [user] [punishment reason]. Make sure that the note written gives an explaination about why the player has banned. It is advised that you attatch a screenshot of the punishment in the thread connected to the note.**`
