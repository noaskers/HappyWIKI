### âœ… Offensive Behavior Guidelines

The following behaviors will not be tolerated on this platform:

* Making offensive or inappropriate statements, such as comments about tragic events or harmful historical figures.
* Engaging in sexual or intimate remarks towards others.
{% endhint %}

These behaviors are generally detected by the chat filter. In most cases, the filter will automatically mute the user. Staff should only take action if users repeatedly bypass the filter or intentionally violate the rules.

***

### Consequences for Violations:

1. **First Offense**: Warning + Temporary Mute (1 hour)
2. **Second Offense**: Warning + Temporary Mute (8 hours)
3. **Third Offense**: Warning + Temporary Mute (24 hours)
4. **Repeat Offenses**: Warning + Temporary Mute (3 days or 7 days, depending on the severity)

### ðŸš¨ Zero-Tolerance Policy for Extreme Behavior

The use of extreme or personally offensive terms, including but not limited to hate speech or explicit remarks, will result in an immediate harsher punishment, advancing one step higher on the punishment scale.

If a new player engages in offensive behavior immediately upon joining, they will receive a 30-day ban for "No intention to play."

**Definition of New Player**:\
A player who has joined less than 7 days ago and/or has less than 5 hours of playtime.

### ðŸ“Œ Staff Expectations

If unsure about how to handle a situation, consult with senior staff for guidance.
