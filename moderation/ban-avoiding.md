# Ban avoiding

{% hint style="info" %}
**Examples:** <mark style="color:blue;">Playing with an alt account while your main account is banned will always result in a ban that lasts</mark> as long <mark style="color:blue;">as the original ban given. However, if a player was evading a permanent ban,they must be given an IP ban. Alternatively, you can use `/alts` to check the alt accounts of banned players. **Be aware** that players are able to avoid the alt detection by using a VPN.</mark>
