{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: <mark style="color:orange;">The use of extreme swear words such as "faggot", "homo", "fuck you bitch", and similar terms that are personally offensive will immediately lead to a harsher punishment (one step up in the punishment list). If a new player immediately swears and/or spams, a 30d ban will be given for 'No intention to play'. New players are those who joined less than 7 days ago and/or have less than 5 hours of playtime.</mark>
