### âœ… Allowed Swear Words & Chat Guidelines

The following mild swear words are allowed, as long as they are not used to harass, insult, or target others:

* wtf, omfg, shit, damn, hell, crap, pissed, frick, dang, heck, ass (non-directed), and other similar non-offensive terms.
{% endhint %}

Most swear words are caught by the chat filter. You generally won't need to take action unless users repeatedly attempt to bypass it or spam offensive terms. In most cases, the chat filter will automatically mute the user.

***

### Consequences for Violations:

1. **First Offense**: Verbal warning
2. **Second Offense**: Warning + Temporary Mute (1 hour)
3. **Third Offense**: Warning + Temporary Mute (24 hours)
4. **Repeat Offenses**: Warning + Temporary Mute (3 days or 7 days, depending on the severity)

### ðŸš¨ Zero-Tolerance Policy for Extreme Language

The use of extreme or personally offensive terms (e.g., "faggot," "homo," "fuck you bitch") will result in an immediate harsher punishment, advancing one step higher on the punishment scale.

If a new player engages in swearing and/or spamming immediately upon joining, they will receive a 30-day ban for "No intention to play."

**Definition of New Player**:\
A player who has joined less than 7 days ago and/or has less than 5 hours of playtime.

### ðŸ“Œ Staff Expectations

If unsure about how to handle a situation, consult with senior staff for guidance.
