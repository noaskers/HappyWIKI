### âœ… Allowed Swear Words & Chat Guidelines

The following **mild swear words** are **allowed**, as long as they are not used to harass, insult, or target others:\
**wtf, omfg, shit, damn, hell, crap, pissed, frick, dang, heck, ass** (non-directed), and other similar non-offensive terms.
{% endhint %}

Most swear words are caught by the chat filter. You generally won't need to take action unless users repeatedly attempt to bypass it or spam offensive terms. In most cases, the chat filter will automatically mute the user.
