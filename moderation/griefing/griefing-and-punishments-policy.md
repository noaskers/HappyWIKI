# Griefing & Punishments Policy

## 1. **Reporting Griefing in Unclaimed Areas**

* Players have **2-3 days** to report griefing in unclaimed areas.
* This time limit prevents staff from being overwhelmed while still protecting the server and its players.

## 2. **What Counts as Griefing?**

### **Minor Griefs:**

* Small damage like a few broken blocks, crops, or stolen items.

### **Major Griefs:**

* Large-scale damage requiring a rollback or significant repairs.

## 3. **Griefing Punishments**

### **Minor Griefs**

| Offense            | Punishment                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| First Minor Grief  | Verbal warning                        |
| Second Minor Grief | Formal `/warn`                        |
| Third Minor Grief  | Temporary ban                         |
| Further Offenses   | Harsher punishments based on severity |

### **Major Griefs**

| Offense            | Punishment                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| First Major Grief  | Temporary ban                       |
| Second Major Grief | Extended ban                        |
| Further Offenses   | Permanent ban (at staff discretion) |

## 4. **Why This Policy Matters**

Unclaimed areas are still part of the server and are protected under **Rule 11**, which focuses on keeping the world clean and enjoyable. Even if a player hasn't claimed an area, griefing disrupts the experience for others.

By following these guidelines, staff can handle griefing fairly while keeping the server a positive place for everyone.
