# Notes Usage

Staff members can now create and manage notes for players directly in-game. This system helps track important information or behavior patterns over time.

### Available Commands

* `/note <player>`\
  Displays a list of all notes associated with the specified player.
* `/note add <player> <note>`\
  Adds a new note to the specified player. This note will also be sent to the staff channel for visibility.
* `/note remove <player> <id>`\
  Removes a specific note from the player.\
  The `id` refers to the number shown next to the note when using `/note <player>`.

### Automatic Notifications

When a player with active notes joins the server, their notes will automatically be displayed in your chat. This helps staff stay informed and take action if necessary.

### Staff Expectations

* Use the note system responsibly and only for relevant, factual information.
* Do not use notes to express personal opinions or judgments.
* Notes should be clear, concise, and professional.
* If in doubt, consult with senior staff before adding sensitive information.

This system is a tool to help staff coordinate and maintain a safe and informed community. Please use it with care and integrity.
