## What is a guide

A Guide is a staff member with more experience and greater responsibilities than a Recruit. They handle more challenging situations, assist with complex issues, and have additional authority. Guides also mentor and support Recruits, ensuring they perform their duties effectively.

### Responsibilities of a Guide

* Resolve more complex issues such as griefing and claim disputes.
* Support and supervise Recruits.
* Handle tickets in Discord.
* Undo punishments such as `/unmute`, `/unwarn`, and `/unban` when appropriate.

***

### Guide Permissions & Commands

Guides have access to all Recruit commands, plus the following:

```markup
/co lookup
/spawn <player>
/homes <player>
/tppos <X> <Y> <Z>
/trust <player>
/playtime <player>
/gmsp
/gms
/warnlist <player>
/history <player>
/unwarn <player> <reason> (-p)
/unmute <player> (-p)
/unban <player> (-p)
/tpsbar;
/ignoreclaims;
```

**Note:** Adding `-p` at the end of a command makes the action visible to the entire server. By default, punishments are hidden from chat.
