# ‚≠ê Ranks

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">On the server, we have different ranks for staff members, each with their own tasks and powers. These ranks help divide the work and make sure every staff member knows what to do. As you get more experience and show you are responsible, you can move up to higher ranks with more powers. Each rank is important for keeping order and making sure all players have a fun time on HappySMP.</mark>
