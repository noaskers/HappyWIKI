### What is a Moderator?

A Moderator (Mod) is a senior staff member responsible for handling serious rule violations, maintaining server stability, and assisting both players and staff members. They have more authority than Guides and are trusted with managing high-impact situations.

### Responsibilities of a Moderator

* Handle severe rule-breaking incidents such as hacking, threats, and major griefing.
* Review and act on player reports and appeals.
* Supervise and support Recruits and Guides.
* Resolve major disputes and escalated issues.
* Ensure the overall safety and fairness of the server.

### Moderator Permissions & Commands

Moderators have access to all Guide commands, plus the following:

```markup
/tempban <player> <duration> <reason> (-p)
/permban <player> <reason> (-p)
/jail <player> <time> <reason>
/unjail <player>
/rollback <player> <time>
/freeze <player>
/ipban <player>
/unipban <player>
/chatmute <duration> <reason>
/unchatmute
/clearchat
/tphere <player>
/invsee <player> (modify mode)
/ec <player>
```

**Note:** Adding `-p` at the end of a command makes the action visible to the entire server. By default, punishments are hidden from chat.
