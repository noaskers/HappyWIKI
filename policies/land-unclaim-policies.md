  These guidelines explain when and how staff can unclaim player-owned land. The
  goal is to balance fair land management while respecting player builds. Claims can only be unclaimed by Mods and above, so if a claim must be removed please consult them.

# Land Unclaim Policies

## 1. **When Land Can Be Unclaimed**

* **No Builds**: Land can only be unclaimed if there’s **nothing built on it**. Natural structures (e.g., villages, spawners, Custom structures) **don’t count** as player builds—players can claim these without issue and keep them.
* **Inactive Players**: Land with player builds can only be unclaimed if the owner has been offline for **30+ days**, usually if it blocks other player claims.

## 2. **Early Unclaims**

In some cases, land can be unclaimed **before 30 days** if:

* The claim has **no player builds** on it.
* The build has **no valuable items** (e.g., no rare blocks, chests with loot).
* The player has **no homes set** on the land.
* The player is **not at that location** when you teleport to them using `/otp`.

## 2. **Late Unclaims**

In more advanced cases, land with bases, chestshops, and builds can be unclaimed if:

* The claim is owned by a permanently banned player, and a player has requested it to be removed.
* The claim owner has given explicit permission to a player to become the new claim owner.
* The player has been offline for more than **60+ days**.
* If the claim has chestshops, they must be fully out of stock.

## 3. **Staff Discretion**

* Always prioritize fairness when unclaiming land.
* If you’re unsure whether land should be unclaimed, consult a senior staff member.

By following these guidelines, we ensure fair land management while respecting active player spaces.
