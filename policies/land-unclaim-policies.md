# Land Unclaim Policies

#### 1. **When Land Can Be Unclaimed**

* **No Builds**: Land can only be unclaimed if there’s **nothing built on it**. Natural structures (e.g., villages, spawners, Custom structures) **don’t count** as player builds—players can claim these without issue and keep them.
* **Inactive Players**: Land with player builds can only be unclaimed if the owner has been offline for **30+ days**ys\*\*, usually if it blocks other player claims.

#### 2. **Early Unclaims**

In some cases, land can be unclaimed **before 30 days** if:

* The claim has **no player builds** on it.
* The build has **no valuable items** (e.g., no rare blocks, chests with loot).
* The player has **no homes set** on the land.
* The player is **not at that location** when you teleport to them using `/otp`.

#### 3. **Staff Discretion**

* Always prioritize fairness when unclaiming land.
* If you’re unsure whether land should be unclaimed, consult a senior staff member.

By following these guidelines, we ensure fair land management while respecting active player spaces.
