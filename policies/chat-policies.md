  These rules explain how staff should handle player messages and chat
  moderation. The goal is to keep things fair while allowing players to
  communicate.

# Chat Policies

## 1. **ChatSentry Plugin**

* **No Manual Action**: If a player is flagged by the ChatSentry plugin (like for spam or filtered words), **staff should not take additional action**.
* **When to Step In**: If a player is clearly trying to bypass the filter (e.g., using weird spellings or symbols) or is being toxic, staff should step in.

### **Take Action If:**

* A player keeps trying to get around the filter.
* There’s harassment or toxic behavior not caught by the plugin.
* Someone uses extreme language or makes threats.

### 2. **Muted Players**

* **Using Signs**: Muted players **can** use signs to communicate as long as they don’t break the rules.
* **When It’s a Problem**: If a muted player uses signs to swear, harass, or break other chat rules, staff can take further action.

**Why This Rule?**: We can’t fully block sign messages, so they’re allowed unless misused.

## 3. **Staff Judgment**

* Use your best judgment and only step in when it’s really needed.
* If you’re unsure, check with a senior staff member.

Stick to these guidelines to keep things fair and the community positive.
